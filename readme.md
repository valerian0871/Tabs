## 📋 How the Tabs Work

- Each tab button has a `data-tab` attribute.
- The value of the `data-tab` attribute matches the `id` of its corresponding content section.
- When a tab is clicked:
  - All tabs are reset to inactive
  - All tab contents are hidden
  - The clicked tab becomes active
  - The matching content is displayed
- The first tab is active by default when the page loads.
